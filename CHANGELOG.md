# Changelog

All notable changes to Sparvi Core will be documented in this file.

### Added
- Full BigQuery connection support with `sqlalchemy-bigquery` and `google-cloud-bigquery` drivers
- Full Redshift connection support with `sqlalchemy-redshift` driver
- BigQueryConnectionManager with optimized settings (location, billing limits, NullPool)
- RedshiftConnectionManager with security defaults (SSL, timeouts)
- Enhanced validation operator support: added symbolic operators (`>`, `<`, `==`, `>=`, `<=`, `!=`) alongside verbose names
- Updated connection factory to route BigQuery/Redshift connections to specialized managers
